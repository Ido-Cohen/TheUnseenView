# TheUnseenView

The Unseen View is a groundbreaking platform that aims to bridge the visual gap for blind individuals through the power of tactile imaging. This innovative web application integrates advanced image processing and 3D printing technologies to create meaningful experiences for those without sight.

Here's how it works: Users submit an image to the platform, which then utilizes object detection algorithms to segment the image into distinct components. Once the image is segmented, users have the opportunity to select a unique tactile pattern for each segment, allowing them to customize the final product to their liking and familiarity. They can also choose a desired background brightness, adding another dimension of customization.

The magic happens when the server generates a 3D printable STL file, which is essentially a tactile map of the original image. This lithophane is unique in that each image segment is represented by a distinct pattern, which blind individuals can feel and understand. To make the experience even more accessible, the bottom of the lithophane includes a legend in Braille, with each pattern described for the user's reference.

The importance of The Unseen View cannot be overstated. It represents a significant leap forward in making visual information accessible to blind individuals. This project enables them to "see" and comprehend images in a way they couldn't before, thereby expanding their understanding of the world. It's not just about enabling access to visual information, but doing so in a way that's intuitive, customizable, and meaningful for the user.

Whether it's for educational purposes, personal interest, or simply the joy of exploring a new way to experience images, The Unseen View holds immense potential. It's a step toward a world where visual impairment doesn't limit access to visual information, fostering inclusivity and understanding in our increasingly visual world.

The Unseen View isn't just revolutionary in its mission, it also boasts an impressively user-friendly interface, making the process of creating tactile images both simple and enjoyable. The streamlined operation of the site allows even those with minimal technical skills to navigate with ease.

Once the image has been segmented, users are then prompted to choose a unique tactile pattern for each segment. This selection process is made simple and intuitive, with a user-friendly tool that allows for easy customization. The same goes for the selection of background brightness, which can be adjusted with a simple slider tool.

The final step is the generation of the 3D STL file. With the click of a button, the server creates the tactile map, incorporating all the user's customizations. The file is then ready to be downloaded and 3D printed.
