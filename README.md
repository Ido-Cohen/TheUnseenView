# The Unseen View
This is a React-based user interface for a project that converts a 2D image into a 3D STL file. The project uses a combination of image processing and 3D modeling algorithms to create the STL file, which can be used for 3D printing and other applications.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies. You will also need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

# Clone the repository

# Change into the project directory

# Install the dependencies
npm install
Once you have installed the dependencies, you can start the development server using the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This will start the server and open the application in your default browser. You can now start using the application to convert 2D images into 3D STL files.

Usage
To use the application, simply drag and drop a 2D image file into the designated area on the application. The application will then process the image and generate a 3D STL file based on the image's content.

You can customize the settings for the 3D model, such as the size and resolution, before generating the STL file. Once you are satisfied with the settings, simply click the "Generate STL" button to create the file.

Contributing
If you would like to contribute to this project, please feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request. We welcome contributions of all kinds, including bug fixes, new features, and improvements to the user interface.
